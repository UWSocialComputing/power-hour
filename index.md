Students spend more time waiting than getting help at office hours. Power Hour is a sleek new Office Hours queuing system for CSE courses that helps students make better use of their wait-time.

Power hour is easy to use:
1. **Join the queue:** Fill out a form to enter the queue. Use the table see what others are working on and if they’re open to collaborate.
2. **Collaborate:** See other students in the queue working on the same question? Join a chat room to work together while waiting.
3. **Save time:** Check when the TA will be available to help with the Estimated Wait-time (based on previous wait-times, question type, and queue position).
4. **Stay updated:** Receive a notification when you’re near the front of the queue or get invited to collaborate.
